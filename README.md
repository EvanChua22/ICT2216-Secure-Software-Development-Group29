<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
Granny Ying's Attic Threads Clothing Store is an online platform for buying and selling vintage clothing items. The vintage clothing market is currently oversaturated with overpriced items and plagued by scammers, making it difficult for genuine enthusiasts to find quality pieces. This app addresses these issues by providing a secure and user-friendly platform for buying and selling vintage clothing. The application is built using Flask and Python, with SQLite as the database, and Docker and Jenkins for DevOps.
